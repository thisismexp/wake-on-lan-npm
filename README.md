This package implements the Wake on LAN functionality (creates and sends a UDP-WOL-Packet) as npm-module.
Use the provided exe file as command line utility or the exported functions. This module is mainly written as part of an assignment at university, but feel free to use it. But sadly it is not well tested, documented and also not maintained.
